In this mini project, I trained several NER models to identify 10 annotated labels from the [**QUAERO French Medical Corpus**](https://quaerofrenchmed.limsi.fr/) dataset: 
- Anatomy (ANAT)
- Chemical and Drugs (CHEM)
- Devices (DEVI)
- Disorders (DISO)
- Geographic Areas (GEOG)
- Living Beings (LIVB)
- Objects (OBJC)
- Phenomena (PHEN)
- Physiology (PHYS)
- Procedures (PROC)

then performed comparisons between the models based on their test results.
